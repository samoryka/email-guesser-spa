# README

## Run the application: `npm start`
## Run tests: `npm test`

## Pitfalls of my implementation:

- This app is build with Create React App. For a more consequent project, I would've probably gone with a more thorough/opinionated framework like Next.js
- With more time, I would've liked to add more tests. Mainly ones for App.tsx where we'd mock the http call
- This app is not internationalized, it should be even though it's only in English for now
- Most likely other things I'm not seeing right now :)
